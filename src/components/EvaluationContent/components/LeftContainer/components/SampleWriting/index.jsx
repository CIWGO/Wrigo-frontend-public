      Nowadays, our environment suffers from plastic packaging and plastic bags,
      plastic does a great damage to the planet. In this essay, the actions how
      to solve the plastic problem will be mentioned and what can be done to
      lower the use of plastic packaging will be discussed. Firstly, plastic
      products are usually thrown under the ground, so that it is able to cause
      ground pollution, the soil becomes poor. It is one of the reasons why
      trees and plants do not grow as they used to fifty years ago. Secondly,
      production of plastic causes air pollution. Factories that produce plastic
      bags, packaging and other plastic products emmit exhaust fumes to the
      atmosphere. All of the facts mentioned can prove that plastic pollution
      plays the leading role in the list of environmental problems. What
      pollution abutement can be done to lower the risk of Earth damaging?
      First, plastic bags can be changed to bags made of natural materials like
      clothes of wood. To realize this, factories should lower the production of
      plastic bags and change ther to more natural products. Moreover, the
      problem of ground pollution because of plastic production should be
      discussed in social media to let people know the scope of plastic problem.
      Second, already used plastic can be recycled in other products. There is a
      Russian programm of recycling plastic into T-shirts, caps and even balls
      for football and basketball. In conclusion, I would like to say that,
      nowadays, people appear as the main reason of environmental problems, the
      manufacturing of plastic products increases the risk of the further Earth
      life. Everything should be done to lower the risk of destroying the
      planet. Second, already used plastic can be recycled in other products. There is a
